Clapham Park Group Practice,"Everyone I have ever dealt with at Clapham Park GP has been kind and approachable, from the reception team to the GP’s themselves"
Clapham Park Group Practice,"I recently saw one of the nurses in the practice on an emergency basis.  She has been absolutely fantastic, arranging further appointments, providing me with written guidance on what I need to do, comforting me when I was struggling.  She has the most fantastic way about her, she is sympathetic, caring and extremely kind.  I really can’t thank her enough."
Open Door Surgery,"You previously used to be able to phone and book an appointment easily, and availability was often good. It would take a couple of minutes to book the appointment, and at most, you had to put aside an hour from your day to attend.
They've now introduced a system whereby you're sent a text message  directing you to an online form, once this has been filled out, you have to wait to receive call back. When I tried to use it, I never received a call back. This means that I couldn't make or receive calls, or join meetings at work, as taking the call to get an appointment was my priority. It also means that you can't make any plans, because you don't know whether you'll be offered an appointment at 2pm, or 3pm, or tomorrow. This system is completely inconsiderate of people who have jobs that mean they can't spend all day waiting for a call, or people who have difficulty with technology. It's in no way an improvement over making an appointment over the phone in two minutes."
Open Door Surgery,"The doctors and staff at Open Door surgery are great. Very committed, detailed oriented and caring and provide good patient care. 

However, recently they have moved to a no appointment system which means it is impossible to plan how long it will take to be seen. Appreciate that such may work better for them. However, does not consider that patients need to schedule doctor visits among work and other commitments. Making it impossible to plan. I have had to wait over an hour on more that one occasion and at times just had to give up waiting. 

Hence, a better system that puts patients first needs to be considered."
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"I was contacted by the GP to make a non-urgent appointment and used the E consult service to book. I was given a face to face appointment very quickly and the doctor was extremely helpful.
My whole family has always received excellent care at this practice and we all feel very spoiled and grateful"
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"Very efficient visit, on time and easy to navigate. Well looked after and answered all questions leaving feeling well looked after"
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,I was able to arrange a F2F appointment within a fortnight / The appointment was on time / A way forward was agreed.
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"I called up at 8am to book a GP appointment for my 5- year old son. Asked for a face to face and was given a 10am slot. No issues with this.

I arrived with my son at 9.45 and registered. Sat waiting. At 10.45 I asked why the delay and the receptionist confirmed I was confirmed and should be soon. 11.15 (90 mins after arriving) I was told that the appointment would be by telephone and not face to face. I asked if I could be squeezed in but was given a blunt No.
Then was told I would be called by 6pm. I saw how some of the people there (some elderly) were spoken to and treated. Shocking.

This is my 3rd visit where it gets worse. I will be moving to another practice. Awful Practice."
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"The GPs at this practice are generally good, but are badly let down by extremely poor communication via the administrators. One example of this is that I was told twice last week that I needed a GP consultation to change the formulation of a medicine I regularly take, only to discover today that my request had actually been processed already and a prescription had been waiting at the pharmacy for me for a week. I have been in desperate need of this medicine. No one thought it necessary to tell me that this had been done, despite having been in correspondence on this matter all week. This is just one in a list of examples of similarly poor communication from this practice. For this reason I cannot recommend Bedford Hill Family Practice to new patients."
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,I contacted the GP via the link to an on line form on which I described my symptoms. A GP rang me and arranged a face to face appointment that morning.  I was reassured to be seen so promptly. I was suffering from a persistent high temperature headache and rash.
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"This has been my gp practice for 30 years and all the staff and doctors have been absolutely fantastic to me and my family. They are helpful, they listen and the receptionists are always ready to listen and organise appointments immediately with the doctors who have been so wonderful to us all.  I feel extremely lucky to be a patient of this practice. Thank you to all the staff for doing a great job. It is so appreciated."
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,I have personally felt let down by the practise each time I come into contact with them which is a shame as one of the nurses there is absolutely amazing. First it was loosing my bloods and having to come in twice for blood tests which prolonged my diagnosis and then I was left frustrated with having telephone consultations with one Dr to be told by another Dr at the same practise that I should never have had a telephone consultation as I really needed to be seen to diagnosed. The wait list for appointments whenever I’ve called as been 3 weeks + and if you need a same day appointment you may as well skip and call 111 instead as the practise are full by 08:01 though I’ve had occasions even when 111 have arranged an ‘emergency call’ I have not received any call backs. This has happened  to me twice. Perhaps I’ve had bad luck and bad timing with extremely busy times I’ve been in contact them with but I feel like everything is much harder than it needs to be. I’m in the process of moving surgeries and for the first time in my life it’s because of the surgery and not because of a house move. I come from a family of NHS staff and understand the pressures but it’s my health that has been affected.
BEDFORD HILL FAMILY PRACTICE,"Today I waited 1 hour and 49 minutes for a receptionist to answer the phone. Was 1st in the queue for about 35 minutes. The receptionist answered and was very abrupt and clearly wanted to get me off the phone as soon as they could. They provided information about me without confirming my details which is a clear data protection breach. I truly understand the stress in primary care due to my profession but this level of service is far below the minimum and is clear that the operation management team at this practice have neglected reception and do not support them in being able to help patients. I have been registered at the surgery for 25 years and have seen how the surgery has not aligned with the increased number of patients registered with the surgery. I really hope this feedback is taken into consideration.
Thanks"
Balham Health Centre,"I was referred to the centre for a blood test that needed to be done quickly.  I arrived thinking my appointment was at 09.45, but I was wrong: my letter clearly showed it to be for 09.15.  The receptionist was very kind and understanding, and sorted my test for me there and then.  Thank you!"
Grafton Square Surgery,"As someone who finds going to the doctor quite nerve-wracking, my first experience at Grafton Square has really restored my confidence. I felt the drive to understand my problem and the drive to fix it in a way that was convenient to me. I left feeling heard and like my problem was taken seriously, and I felt positive about finding a cause and treatment."
Grafton Square Surgery,This practice is excellent in after care   My husband has has such great treatment from this practice since being discharged from hospital. He is difficult chap but the staff understand his frustration and have also offered me support as his career. Can't fault them and appreciate the care.
Dr Curran & Partners,After waiting a month for a telephone consultation for my children ( was told I had to have a telephone consultation when I asked for an on-person app) the receptionist booked it informing me I would br called in the am. Today I was called at 7:03 am. This call I missed (getting my children ready for the school run). The very helpful Dr. left a voicemail stating a number I should call back. This was the surgery contact number which is not answered until after 8 am. I suspect my children are suffering with mould sickness and I have found worrying lumps on my child’s neck which I would like clinical advise on. This is now way to run a health service.
Dr Curran & Partners,"Friendly, able to get an appointment if you call. GPS are thorough, kind, and caring. They make the time despite all the pressures and increase caseload."
Dr Curran & Partners,"As always the receptionists were efficient, helpful and considerate. Despite the pressures of work they remain cheerful and good humoured. The practice nurse was thoughtful and understanding. My GP, whom I have known for many years, is outstanding in her professionalism and the care she gives me."
Dr Curran & Partners,"Excellent service from Dr Curran and partners today-from my call being answered promptly by very helpful friendly reception staff, to a GP call back within half an hour followed by an urgent appt a couple of hours later. The reception staff I then saw were helpful and friendly and the GP absolutely brilliant with my 3 year old. Thank you!"
Dr Curran & Partners,"I recently joined the practice and I am very happy that I did. Receptionists are friendly and answered my questions efficiently.
I saw 2 nurses, each one provided painless procedures and were friendly. And I saw 2 doctors. There was no rush, my concerns were addressed, callback was prompt, informative and punctual.
I find waiting rooms also important, this one has ample seating, is clean and quiet, and I love the blood pressure/weight/height device (even though I am smaller than I thought)."
Dr Curran & Partners,"The nurses at this surgery are fantastic, I had a smear test / cervical screening with a nurse who made the whole thing very easy and stress free after I told her I was a little anxious.

However, understanding of unseen disabilities is poor. Last week I spoke to a receptionist who had received no training on Accessibility requirements (which are a legal obligation). I had previously had a note on my patient record added to access and communication requirements stating I require email correspondence due to my disability which affects my memory and verbal processing. Despite this I was phoned today by a receptionist and when I stated that this is an inaccessible way to contact me she said she didn’t know what accessibility is and that speaking on the phone is “easier for her”. The interaction was humiliating and conflicted with the reassurance past receptionists had given me that their colleagues would understand the accessibility needs recorded on my patient record. It upset me on a huge number of levels and scared me for any patients with learning disabilities, learning difficulties, mental health conditions, Alzheimer’s, hearing loss, etc.  Despite everything I got an email later that day saying she’d booked me a telephone appt."
Wandsworth Medical Centre,"Completed online form for medication, only 1 was prescribed. Phoned the surgery receptionist said she would bring this to doctors attention and doctor will contact me or send prescription to pharmacy. Check with pharmacy no prescription received. Phoned surgery spoke to another receptionist who repeated the rhetoric of the previous receptionist, and I'm still waiting.  This practice  has changed immensely in years  gone by it was possible to see a gp without  having to complete a longwinded form, personal experience  suggests this system is not an improvement in how things used to be.  Is it not common courtesy for someone to get back to you when you are told that they will? Would it not be advisable for someone to explain why you have not been prescribed the painkillers you requested several days ago? What would WMC suggest patients in need of painkillers do if they have requested them and followed it up with not 1 but 2 phone calls enquiring about them only to still be left waiting?  Clearly something going on here, however they appear to have forgotten to relay this to me the patient."
Wandsworth Medical Centre,"I saw someone left a complaint about problems accessing the contraceptive pill at this surgery - and I have too! I’ve been repeat prescribing the pill for about 2 years and didn’t have a problem when it was done with paper, always got my pills within about 2 working days. However, over 2 weeks ago I put in a request online, the GP didn’t receive anything. Tried again on the online form - still nothing! After going into the surgery they’ve now sent me something direct to fill in, which I’m hoping (nearly 3 weeks later) will mean I get the pills. If not, I’m about to have to buy them online which isn’t ideal but I’m about to run out. It’s really really poor to be unable to have access to easy contraception - there is clearly a fault with your online contraceptive pill form. Please fix it ASAP."
Wandsworth Medical Centre,"I am going travelling for 8 months tomorrow. When I was due for my contraceptive pill repeat prescription at the end of July/early Aug, I requested many times that I receive additional months worth of pills so that when I am travelling with my boyfriend I am protected; I have also been on this pill for over 8 years and I don’t really want to come off it for hormonal reasons. I had many issues with requesting repeat prescriptions on the online system. I had to go into the practice twice and show them that I was doing it correctly but it still never showed my request in the system. I then completed a paper form, adding my request for additional months, but when I collected it, I only received 3 months worth. The pharmacy told me to contact them 2 months before I go to request additional pills, which I did and they then contacted WMC. To achieve this, I had to fill out another form to answer a few GP questions which I did straight away. When I collected again - still not enough pills. I called the surgery again last week to get a request to send it to a different pharmacy as I was leaving London. When I went to see if they had arrived, they hadn’t. I am going away tomorrow with not enough pills to last me the trip. Absolutely abysmal that it’s so difficult to get contraception and having to waste so much time trying to get a simple request. I have never had issues at any previous doctors getting more than 3 months of pills. Will definitely tell all of my friends to avoid this practice. Surely you should be doing more to make contraception options accessible amongst young people?"
Wandsworth Medical Centre,"I’ve been going through a very difficult health scare and called in to get a timeline on when my tests are due. 

The demeanour of the lady on the phone was appalling. Seemingly like I’ve intruded on her day she just conveyed the message of ‘how are we supposed to know’ and just appeared to want to get me off the phone. No empathy of the caller and actually hung up on me without a goodbye. Incredibly unfriendly and not someone who should ever be speaking with patients at times we’re just seeking clarity. 

Doctors have been fantastic. This woman (I could point her voice out) does not represent the practice well at all. I actually feel unhealthier just from talking to her. Fowl experience"
Wandsworth Medical Centre,"Their clinicians are fantastic, but the management of the practice is below any standards. It is not possible to book an appointment. The practice opens its phone lines at 8:00 am. How is it possible, that when I ring spot on 8:00 am, I am already number over 30 in the queue? Then, I wait for over 45 minutes on the phone to be connected to the receptionist, just to find out, that all the appointments for the day are taken and no clinician is available. It is not possible to book an appointment in advance. So the receptionist advises calling next day again 8:00 am and face the same case scenario. Waiting for nearly an hour to be unable to book an appointment again. The practice do not offer enough of appointments via The GP app or via Patient Access portal. They are limited date and time wise. Someone should look into this shambolic services, that ones, before the pandemic, used to run smoothly, without any flow. I am aware of the NHS staff shortages and increased post-pandemic demands for appointments, but it should be possible to book an appointment in advance, that suit the patient, especially when it comes to booking an appointment for a child. This is why the A&Es are congested, because people with minor problem cannot get appointments at their practices."
TOOTING SOUTH MEDICAL CENTRE,"I was treated very well by the doctor, exceeding my expectations. The doctor was patient and kind despite the language barrier as I still don't speak English very well.  She requested some tests and I'm waiting for the appointment."
TOOTING SOUTH MEDICAL CENTRE,"I was treated by the doctor ( and Practice) very well ...
Quick problem detection, life assessment and quick help"
TOOTING SOUTH MEDICAL CENTRE,"Totally impressed by the level of efficiency, courtesy and professionalism shown by members of staff in the practice."
Akerman Medical Practice,"Despite lovely admin staff, ease of submitting e-consults and rapid telephone responses from the on-call GP, I have never felt so undervalued, dismissed or judged by Drs than I have since being registered with this practice in early 2022. 

Each time I speak with a doctor from this practice I am rushed, told to not give so much information as it's difficult to write down, told to only answer questions I am asked. 

I finish the phone call in tears most times, have never been offered a face to face appointment and always feel palmed off, not listened to and judged. 

I understand that 10 mins to try and assess and make a management plan for a patient is so difficult to do. It is an unfair pressure you are being put under by external stakeholders however, please put your patients first. 

Make them feel valued, listened too and understood. this may be just another day for you, but for the patient it's an anxiety inducing, worrying day/week leading up to it. Let alone actually plucking up the courage to make the appointment in the first place.

There are a couple of things I haven't been to this GP about and have left untreated and uninvestigated as I'm embarrassed and scared to talk to any of the GPs there. I also don't trust their management or desire to help.

I hate to write this review but my experience has been so awful on several different occasions - I find it difficult to understand the positive reviews left on this website."
Akerman Medical Practice,"I booked a travel vaccination consultation appointment, which as an existing patient cost me £50 but this covered the cost of several jabs and I was able to have them straight away during the consultation after discussing what was necessary."
Akerman Medical Practice,"This practice are truly knowledgable, responsive and kind. They go out of their way to help you. There is always a person at the end of the line and I couldn’t recommend their advice enough."
Akerman Medical Practice,The GP practice uses telephone appointments effectively to sort out most problems virtually on the same day and offers in person appointments when needed. My experience of the practice has always been positive with appointments running to time and knowledgeable staff. Thank you to the GPs and nurses and reception staff for their hard work.
Central Medical Centre,"Thank you dr. j,Your caring and extra effort to make us comfortable is truly remarkable. Thank you your kindness and care for our 95 year old dad.  Thank you for your dedicated service."
Central Medical Centre,"In London it is often difficult to find a gp surgery that genuinely cares about you as a patient but I have had nothing but a positive experience at the central medical centre. 
The reception staff are always quick to respond to my queries and book me appointments. The practitioners I work with take their time with me and always make me feel like they genuinely care about my well being and do not rush through appointments.  
A wonderful service throughout"
Central Medical Centre,"I attended the practice on Saturday 4th Feb 2023 for an appointment with a nurse for a smear test. I was feeling a little nervous about my appointment but she was amazing at making me feel calm and at ease about the smear. She made sure I was completely ready before carrying it out and made sure I didn't have any questions or worries before she did anything. She knew I was a bit nervous and so took her time and explained everything to me and made sure I was comfortable throughout. A lovely lady, kind, compassionate and really put my mind at ease."
Central Medical Centre,The practice has been very supportive of my condition and provided me with the best help required. I have been with the practice for over 15 years. They have alway provided me with the best care and support.
Central Medical Centre,"Very caring and friendly doctor! 
Glad to join this surgery. Always reliable and very helpful. Many thanks"
Central Medical Centre,"My medication was out of stock so the Pharmacy emailed my GP prescribe an alternative. The email was ignored and I am now out of medication. This is not the only problem I’ve had! I needed to see a Dr, but was told to wait for a phone call before 12pm. I had to call them at 12.30 to be told the appointment was at 2.30pm….I finally got a call 4.55pm"
Central Medical Centre,"The medical centre is incredibly welcoming, with my GP making me feel at ease and in safe hands. Very attentive and a credit to the NHS. Thank you."
Central Medical Centre,"I’ve been a patient at this practise for my years now and it’s gone downhill a lot o the last few years in my opinion. You get to see a good Dr and build a good relationship then they vanish! Not sure why they leave but got a good idea. Dr they have now is excellent, she listens to what you have to say and you don’t feel rushed and made to feel a nuisance and I hope she stays at the surgery as she is excellent"
Central Medical Centre,"Just wanted to recognise and thank the doctor for seeing me so quickly today and treating me with such dignity, she was very welcoming, positive and put me at ease. Everything a Dr should be. Again I cannot thank her enough and she is a real credit to the surgery in my opinion, especially having been a patient since 1997."
Central Medical Centre,I am very grateful to everyone at Central Medical Centre for the excellent care and help that they have provided to me over many years.
Balham Park Surgery,Moved to this surgery around a month ago due to my previous one closing. Was worried about my daughter who became unwell overnight so called the surgery for the first time. The receptionist was polite and efficient and said I would get a phone consultation within the next three hours! This was somewhat unexpected given at my old doctors it was very much hit or miss whether I could get on the day contact with a GP at all. Not only did a doctor call me within half an hour but they also arranged for me to have a face to face consultation straight away as she was concerned about the symptoms. Both the doctor on the phone consultation and the face to face consultation were really lovely and thorough and it has made me feel extremely reassured for any future health issues my family may have.
Balham Park Surgery,"Moving from another local surgery due to its closure, I was worried as I'd been happy and with the previous one for 34 years. The service, attention to detail and swift response at Balham Park have been impressive. The staff is helpful, patient and friendly, and the locum GP assigned to me has outdone any expectations I had. I've seen him twice so far and I would like him to become my named doctor."
Balham Park Surgery,My doctor has always taken the greatest of care to find the best way forward for my health and treatment. Such kindness and patience are shared throughout the practice by all I have been involved with. Thank you all
Balham Park Surgery,"This surgery has made it near on impossible to book appointments. Neither the patient access or nhs app will let you book a GP, and thier website sends you off for some horrific AI triage stuff that still doesn’t get you a booking. Thier website goes on to tell you to only call “if you really really can’t do it online” (just to frustrate you a little more…). Which you can’t. Why can’t I just book an appointment like anywhere else?"
Balham Park Surgery,"As a new patient I was amazed by the efficiency, courteousness and overall pleasantness of my first experience with reception staff, Health Care Assistants and doctors. I felt everyone was interested in helping and responding to questions."
Balham Park Surgery,"Telephone staff extremely rude, no patience or sympathy and sarcastic. Completely unnecessary, I asked for an urgent prescription and she was so unhelpful."
Balham Park Surgery,"Me and my wife are registered in the practice. Today 25/05/2023 she woke up very dizzy not being able to stand. I called the practice for a medical emergency. The practice told me over the phone that they unilaterally de-registered my wife because of a letter they sent in 01/2023 which they did not have any response. I told her we never got any letter and that I was having a medical urgency. I even asked the lady at the phone to pass me to her manager which she told me she could not do because ""management was in a meeting"". Finally they told me to go to A&E or dial 111 and hung up. I was left speechless. The service our family got was damaging and not humane. Please be careful if you rely on this practice."
Balham Park Surgery,"Everyone knows the pressure the health care system is under. I hadn’t seen a GP for years and was fearing that it would be impossible to get an appointment. But, I got one in no time, fantastic GP who got me a health check and blood test a few days later, referred me for various issues and has telephoned me three times to keep me updated. Superb service, thank you."
Balham Park Surgery,"We have recently transferred to Balham Park Surgery.  Their service is excellent.  Always on time, very efficient and most importantly a very comprehensive and thorough service.  An amazing difference from our previous practice of some 30 years."
Battersea Rise Group Practice,"I have been using this practice for about five years and I’m consistently impressed. The ladies on reception are so helpful, particularly when it comes to enrolling and then getting appointments for babies, The doctors all have an excellent bedside manner, and the nursing facilities are wonderful. I have been in a dozen times since Covid started for various immunisations and pregnancy related appointments and The nurse was incredible with my children and so friendly and kind. 

Twice so far in 2022 I have needed emergency appointments for my very young baby and both times I have been seen in person within an hour of speaking on the phone (and phone consultations have been immediate or within an hour or so). I feel very lucky to have this GP practice on my door step"
Palace Road Surgery,"On several occasions recently I was struck by the immense effort put in by my GP, and two additional admin staff who went above and beyond to assist me in person, by email and via a phone call. This surgery has never failed to impress me either care, their efficiency and the warmth with which they deliver their service. It isn’t the very nearest or most convenient surgery to reach as I’ve moved a little further away but I couldn’t move from here because I know the service is first class. Thank you very much Palace Road team. When sick or concerned about my health you’ve consistently been precisely the response I’ve needed, and this I give thanks. Keep up the great work!"
Palace Road Surgery,Quick easy service especially on line some things are more convenient and easier then ringing. not always easy to get an appointment even when ringing in the morning you can wait for a while eventhough your number 2 on the list only to be told no appointments
Palace Road Surgery,First of all I feel very comfortable talking to my GP. As a disabled person I feel very relaxed with my GP. I can tell my GP everything on my mind. The staff are very polite and very helpful. Especially the manager and the reception team. The lady that dressed my leg was excellent. The team are lovely. Social Prescriber is lovely. I really like coming to my GP Surgery.  I would not change it for the world.
Palace Road Surgery,"Calling for an appointment at 8:00 am has not been successful in the past few years.  Left hanging on the phone to an automated system; when answered no appointment time slot available!!  Attending the practice in person, the staff are very accommodating to my plight and the main GPs obligating to my ill health!  If a referral is required for a 
hospital appointment; there is no hesitation."
Palace Road Surgery,I am very happy with my doctors surgery. They put themselves out to help the patients. All referral letters have been done on time. The admin team and the doctors listen to you and not palm you off. My family and I have been registered at Palace Road Surgery for 38 years. The manager has given me and my husband so much technical help with the nhs app and she is so supportive. When the surgery is busy we are always given an appointment on the same day. We are always received with a lovely smile and feel very welcome.
Palace Road Surgery,"I called at 8am due to concerns I had. I am a health care professional myself so knew the reason was totally justified. I was given a 9:30 appointment, this appointment was then cancelled by the practice and I was told I would instead get a call at 9:30, this never happened. I had to unfortunately call the practice a further 6 times to be continuously told that ‘someone is going to call you still’ or ‘your call will be in 5 minutes’ I had to keep working my work day around this. By 18:30 pm I never got the call. Today I called back to ask about this, the response ‘oh it was a locum so not much we can do’. The reception whom I usually have no issues with made me feel incredibly stupid every time I called back, I understand it’s not their fault but the reason being ‘it’s a locum’ is totally unacceptable as a response to me not getting an appointment I had booked for something that needed medical attention."
Palace Road Surgery,Everybody is so friendly and welcoming I suffer with mental health issues and the surgery is like a safe haven away from the busy streets for the while I'm there
Palace Road Surgery,"Tge whole practice from the Doctors to clinicians  to medical and non medical staff are brilliant  kind supportive and professional 
They have cared for me and my family since 1975"
Palace Road Surgery,Reception staff are always welcoming whenever I come to the practice.  Reception area is spotless! Having my vaccinations with the nurse is always a great experience! Always puts you at ease and is friendly yet so professional.  Thank you to all the team.
Palace Road Surgery,"I’m needle phobic but the phlebotomist put me at my ease, took blood and gave me a flu jab quickly and efficiently. I’d recommend him to anyone who is nervous of injections"
Lavender Hill Group Practice,"I have been to this practice on a number of occasions over the last couple of months, and every time, I have received excellent care. 
All of the doctors and nurses that I have seen have been really friendly and caring and have gone above and beyond to help me. 

I cannot recommend this practice enough and would like to thank all the staff that work there."
Lavender Hill Group Practice,We’ve been with Lavender Hill Group Practice for 12 years and they never fail to impress! The GP’s are thorough and thoughtful - we leave better educated and with solutions. But huge shout out for the administration - everything is geared to efficient helpfulness.  As a patient I see very little bureaucracy- they hire smart friendly receptionists and empower them to solve problems.  If you live anywhere near Clapham Junction it is the only place to go!
Lavender Hill Group Practice,"This practice is a credit to the NHS.
Firstly they answer the phone quickly. The reception is helpful and friendly.
The Doctors and nurses I have seen have been very professional and caring.
I have diabetes and I have never experienced a more thorough diabetic check ever. I then went back to see there diabetic nurse who went through everything with me. I alsoThey follow everything up by phoning me. I can't say how much I appreciate the care I receive."
Lavender Hill Group Practice,"Booked a telephone appointment for 2 weeks time. Phone call on time, went for face to face examination the next day. Hospital appointment arranged promptly, after hospital visit had a phone call and tablets arranged for pick up for same day.
Was very satisfied with the service"
Lavender Hill Group Practice,Excellent and pro active care. The GP I saw was impressive in every way and took time to point me in the right direction in terms of preventative care. I couldn't ask for better having full confidence in the GP I saw. Trust between patient and doctor is paramount and I am truly appreciative -congratulations!
Lavender Hill Group Practice,"Admin staff is very unhelpful. In the beginning they told us that they can confirm that I can discuss the fertility medical issues on behalf of both, me and my wife, as my wife doesn't speak English. Now my wife has left the country to get IVF fertility treatment abroad (NHS doesn't cover it, thanks), so I called to ask for help with copies of our results that we need for our pre-paid fertility treatment abroad and I'm told it can't be discussed with me, although all fertility-related issues were always discussed during appointments with me, i.e. in my name and using my date of birth, and my wife accompanying me to the appointments."
The Exchange Surgery,"I have been with this practice for 6 years. The doctors are lovely, friendly, kind and helpful. I’ve never had a problem booking appointments and always managed to get same day if I needed. (Always use the app to book online). Also really helpful that they have their own blood clinic on site. 
Absolutely gutted that they won’t let me stay registered as I’ve moved 10 minutes up the road and out of the catchment. I’m heartbroken. I’ll never find a practice as good."
The Exchange Surgery,"I have never managed to book an appointment. I tried calling and they said the appointments for the day were gone and for appointments for other days I needed to call ""during the day"". I am not sure what during the day meant as I was calling at around 9.00 am which should count as day? Unless they meant I have to try every hour until I get lucky. Tried with the app and did not work either. Very unhelpful. I appreciate the NHS is under a huge amount of stress but this practice is very disorganised."
Prentis Medical Centre,"Friendly and helpful Pharmacist, [Vip], who was able to sort out medication, blood tests forms hence saving time of not having to book a GP consultation.  This also means that with forward planning the results will be available before any face to face consultation at the surgery.  Thank you for your help."
HETHERINGTON AT THE PAVILION,"After realising I had run out of my prescribed medication the night before (Sunday), I arrived at the surgery less than 20 minutes before it closed to see if I could somehow bypass the normal 48 hour turnaround time for the GP to sign off on my prescription. Despite it being totally my fault, the two ladies in the attached pharmacy did all they could to help me get my medication, when it would've been far easier (and justified) to tell me to come back in 48 hours. One of the ladies went and personally had the prescription signed off by the GP, and the other altered my account to automatically order my prescription every 2 months to ensure I never had to worry about making the same mistake again. Their acts of kindness restored my faith in humanity after a long, tiring Monday. Hopefully they read this and realise their hard work doesn't go unnoticed or unappreciated. Thank you."
Junction Health Centre,"I know there's currently substantial waiting times within the service, yet I never seem to struggle getting appointments here.
The practice has taken me seriously with long-term health issues that doctors in other practices have previously dismissed.
I've always managed to get on-the-day or next-day appointments with acute health conditions also.
Sometimes you may have to wait a while on the phone line (~20 mins), but I have never been disappointed once I've got through :)."
Junction Health Centre,"First of all it is impossible to manage to speak to someone, when i call the surgery i need to wait minutes before the automatic voice message is over but nobody ever answer after that! 
When i finally managed to book an 
appointment with a GP i got a message on the same day the appointment was supposed to happen saying that it will be rescheduled for the next week.
The appointment was supposed to happen today but when i got there they told me that my appointment was cancelled due to doctor sickness and that someone had tried to call me about that ( i clearly haven't received any phonecalls or message about the cancellation)."
Springfield Medical Centre,"I was hung up on three times today, first two trying to book an appointment and then when I called to ask for an email or number to call to."
Springfield Medical Centre,"I filled the online appointment form and received a phone call from the doctor within 10 minutes.. 
Pleased with the quick response and appointment was smooth and reliable. 
Keep up the good work."
Springfield Medical Centre,"Had hip pain for long time ,in November my hip pain was so bad made difficult to walk , stand  sleep  went to gp to be seen she just said its your sciatica do exercises and take the painkillers , got so fed up with the treatment received that she was not believing how painfull was for me ended up paying a private MRI to find that had a tear , that was causing the unbearable pain,"
Springfield Medical Centre,"I would just like to express my appreciation to your amazing practice.  I know people are more likely to complain than compliment and that is how I know how lucky I am.  

My friends wait weeks for an appointment at their surgeries I always get one with you the day I contact you as long as I contact you before 10am - how amazing is that!

My friends cannot get through to their surgery - I call and if your busy I press a number and I get a call back when its my turn - no long queues or cut offs - no sore arms or huffs and puffs here.

Your secretary team is amazing- they chase the hospital up for me, send messages to the GP for me, freeing up time for them speeding things making things so much easier for your patients.  They are superheroes the unsung heroes behind the scenes doing the amazing work that they do, they have been so supportive and helpful, moving things on behind the scenes I cannot thank them enough.

Your GP’s are outstanding my experience has been so positive I have never felt so cared for and empowered by healthcare professionals in all my life.  My initial GP has been outstanding and then I get an appointment with and another outstanding GP who cares deeply about her patients, with empathy and care and also empowering the patient to have control over what is happening as well.  From an initial call with another GP there was clearly some curiosity and not being happy with what specialist at hospital had recommended and had a fresh pair of eyes with some other ideas.  

After nearly 2 years of being unwell I have always felt that the GP’s at your surgery care no matter who I have seen, it has never been a case of just dealing with me and passing me on or just ticking a box.  It has been constant evaluations, checking how I am re-evaluating I have not been just left or dosed up and put to the side.

Everyone I have seen or spoken to nurses, phlebotomy, receptionists, secretaries,GP’s has been absolutely awesome.  You have been through Covid, given us our vaccines and been through so much yourselves. I know you the NHS don’t get many thanks and people don’t appreciate what happens behind the scenes and the demands that you work too.

All I can say is as a patient I consider myself extremely lucky to be a patient of your practice.  I would be in a far worse position today if I did not have an amazing GP support that I have.  I would have definitely lost my job by now and my life would be far worse now.  That is the difference having an amazing GP practice like yours is to someone like me.  Please remember for those people that do complain their situations would be far worse with another practice.  

My personal experience is I have been a ping pong ball around the hospital which has batted me around and this has been completely out of your control.  

Keep being awesome and thank you for everything you are all fantastic - remember for everyone that complains there are hundreds like me that are really happy with you and your service."
Springfield Medical Centre,"The staff here is the most helpful people, if you have any English barrels in Springfield you will found Spanish speakers which is amazing!"
Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre,"I have 8 month old daughter and impossible to get an appointment. Was told to call 8am in the morning..I was first in the queue (still took 15mins to answer) and was told no appointments.

I asked for any future appointment and was refused as for a baby, I need to call 111 or go a&e

Even normal appointments at this gp are 3 weeks in advance. god help us.

This day and age where you can't even get a gp to see a baby. sad times"
Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre,"Hello, I probably haven't found any feedback in my life. However, this is the first time I encounter such NHS workers as Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre. When it comes to my health, I cannot remain silent. I called on Monday and asked for a visit, she asked me when I want and if the same day is suitable, I said that Tuesday is the best for me, she said that's great, I just need to call on Tuesday and they will give me an hour, I did so, but today I was told that the place is no longer available . (The conversation took place at 8:04 a.m.). When I said that I needed it as soon as possible because I no longer have the medicine that I take constantly, they found a place for me only on October 3rd.when I said that I was told to call the same day, she told me that there are no more places, I asked how come there are no more places in 4 minutes, she just tells me ""sorry"". This means I have to go private GP. I just don't understand why we pay for mandatory health insurance if services are not provided to me when they are vitally important to me? I wasn't even asked how long I've had the medicine for, or if it's been a long time since I've had it. Zero politeness, and I'm really considering moving my whole family to another one GP.  I just realized that the health of a person in GP means nothing. it's a pity that I had to choose this GP (to be more precise, I've never been to this GP, ) I wasn't even offered a doctor's consultation after re-appointment, even though they knew that I was constantly taking medication. It's a pity, but I will have to choose another GP, for whom the person's health is important..."
Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre,"The staff are so polite and kind, always ready to go above and beyond to try and help with appointment bookings and chasing referrals for me. All of the Doctors are very thorough in their consultations with me, making sure I receive the best care. They are very respectful and professional at all times. A special shout out has to go to the Practice Manager is very attentive too, as you can see that she works very hard and is very knowledgeable on the NHS - she was happy to answer all of my questions."
Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre,"Prepare to be an hour and a bit on a call listening to ""You are first in the queue"" (looks like they all are just having lunch). And then your problem is still not sorted. in and out of the surgery and pharmacy for a week and the doctor still didn't find time to sign the prescription!!"
Upper Tooting Road Medical Centre,"This is the most brilliant doctor’s surgery… all the doctors I have ever seen are excellent. Always kind, thorough and understanding.
It is a fantastically well run practice with incredibly patient and hard working admin staff. Thank you to the wonderful team at Upper Tooting Surgery!"
St Johns Hill Surgery,"Very inconsiderate staff and GPs. Twice they called me to their practice and upon reaching on time, they made me wait for like 45 mins. 

Above all, their reception staff is so buzy on call that they don't give a damn about the people waiting for their appointment.

Their availability is so much poor that you will get your appointment after a week or month. Never ever register yourself here. Disappointed to see that I'm paying so much tax for surgeries like this and not even getting proper treatment and availability."
Beckett House Practice,"The receptionist is always polite and friendly no matter what. It is not a huge wait on the phone normally either.

Good for people with autism or anxiety. The doctor made me feel very safe and I felt very heard..I could tell she really wanted to hear me and she checked I understood and truly agreed or knew what I was agreeing to..for example she asked me to explain how I used my medication to her, she triple checked with me and asked me in a couple of ways to make sure I really got it. She gave me choices and made sure I was informed and it was incredibly good practice especially regarding informed consent. I got very stressed but she also handled that well. She is an excellent doctor for someone with autism and anxiety.

She also believed me about the side effects my meds has on me and explained why that was. She is one of very few doctors to do that (the other doctors who also listen work for your practice too). It's a good practice.

I felt she really thought about what she was prescribing and my medication..this is something Beckett house actually does very well. Beckett house stands out for not only reviewing meds but actually explaining how they work and helping someone make an Informed decision."
Beckett House Practice,"My GP sent me an online questionnaire on prostrate cancer. Followed instructions and my GP gave me a blood test form. I was amazed that on the day I did the test Tuesday 21s5 March at St. Thomas's, my GP called me up giving me a 12:30 appointment next day, Wednesday 22nd. Services have massively improved at Beckett House.
A very young locum doctor was a good  communicator. A good service."
Beckett House Practice,"Everyone I spoke to was very friendly, the appointment was professional and everything was done to make me feel comfortable with a rather uncomfortable issue I was having. Thank you all!"
Beckett House Practice,"I've been dealing with my condition for a couple of years now and have seen many doctors. I have been to see two doctors at Beckett House Practice in the last few months for tests and to discuss treatment and both have been wonderful. They were empathetic, thorough, considerate, and above all they truly listened to me. It can be upsetting dealing with an ongoing condition, but I truly feel like the doctors cared and will help me get to the bottom of this. They've been very reassuring and I'm very grateful. Thank you."
Beckett House Practice,"I tried to book an appointment over the phone &  the receptionist insisted if I didn't tell her ""the reason"" for the appointment she wasn't going to book the appointment even though I kept telling her that it's personal & would like to discuss it with my doctor. She also tried booking an appointment with another practice & cancelled it the next day & also booked me another appointment over the phone, after waiting for a call for 4 hours no body contacted me.

Previously I had completed an online consultation form but they never got back to me. The receptionist make it very difficult to book an appointment. This is the first time dealing with rude receptionist, I have been with this GP since 2011 but their customer service is not what it used to be.

I asked the receptionist on how I could make a formal complaint or if the could escalate the call but they're really not interested in giving the best patient care that they could give & improve their customer service. I have left my details for the management to contact me.

As a result of this terrible customer service experience, I've decided to change to another local GP.

Doctors are not the issue, some of the reception stuff are the main reason for my dissatisfaction."
Beckett House Practice,"I would highly recommend this GP practice. They are very supportive and responsive, and I feel very cared for. Great GP practice."
Beckett House Practice,"I have been with this practice for 11 years and they are excellent and attentive to patient needs. It’s easy to get an emergency appt, they are quick with referrals and respond to emails."
Beckett House Practice,"I've had a repeat prescription for 4 years now and this practice has never got it right. I've had to go down in person, mere days post operation to beg for the right thing to be sent to the right pharmacy. I've spoken to the manager, I've tried to talk to reception, I've even broken down on a doctor. So far the advice has been ""go elsewhere"". Absolutely shocking place."
Beckett House Practice,"All the Drs , Nurses and Reception staff are amazing. The Drs are incredibly attentive , and off unconditional positive regard as well as a professional disposition. The nurses are also just as professional. The reception team are fabulous, whenever I have called I am treated with the upmost respect and a friendly approachable tone . I have been a patient at Beckett  house for nearly 10 years , and I will never change practice."
Beckett House Practice,"All the staff treats patients with care. They are quick to assist and support looking after the patients. They take the time to listen and assist very promptly.
I would recommend anyone to join the practice."
The Grantham Centre Practice,"This is the best GP surgery I have been to - it's straightforward to get an appointment and they work hard to keep waiting times to a minimum. The reception staff are helpful and friendly, and the doctors I have seen there have been brilliant and reassuring."
The Grantham Centre Practice,"During a rapidly emerging appendicitis situation, the whole staff of the Grantham Centre were constantly concerned for my wellbeing and at all times were expert, professional and courteous.  Brilliant!"
The Grantham Centre Practice,Well I cannot complain.  You get appointment quickly.  The receptionist are friendly and helpful. The Doctors are the type of Doctors we need more of. Patients always come first here. And they always keep you informed of anything medical. They always have time for you. They also make sure you understand everything medical about you and sometimes they even help with social situations. They are there for you and yours
The Grantham Centre Practice,"I cannot begin to express how utterly incredible this GP practice is.  Loving, caring, warm, efficient, and 100% dedicated to the well being of its patients.  I have heard such horror stories from friends up and down the country about their experiences with their GP.
I am always only number 1 in the queue when I phone, and I can't sing the praises enough of the fabulous ladies at reception who are there to greet me on my arrival at the surgery.  They are simply amazing.  I am not a number, I am a person.  As I turn 70 I am fully confident that this wonderful team of doctors and admins will take the very best care of me, and for this reason I 
consider myself truly blessed and am deeply grateful."
The Grantham Centre Practice,"I had a cough that got a lot worse as days went by; I explained to Dr. I need to travel for work and need antibiotics for the chest infection. For some weird reason, I went to the pharmacy and he had failed to submit a prescription; I am coughing my lungs out but need to get on with my life, very primitive, peniciline is there to help people get better, use it."
